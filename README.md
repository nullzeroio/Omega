Omega
=====

The Omega project/tool is a lightweight GUI tool, developed by senior admins, to be used by those less familiar with PowerShell as a means of executing basic server management and reporting tasks from a single, easy to use,  console. Almost all commands executed by any button, or report, are rooted from PowerShell.

PowerShell Studio 2012 was used to draw up the GUI and is required to edit/compile any of the source files, however, they are still readable in raw format if you wish to extract code and use. Sapien does offer a trial at http://www.sapien.com/software/powershell_studio

More detailed info about the tool can be found on the wiki. (button is on the right --->)
